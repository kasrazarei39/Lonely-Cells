# Cell Simulation Program

This is a cell simulation program written in C that simulates the behavior of cells in a grid-based environment. The program allows cells to move, interact, and perform various actions.

## Features

- Cells can move in different directions on the grid.
- Cells can boost their energy by absorbing energy from their surroundings.
- Mitosis feature allows cells to split into two cells under specific conditions.
- The program provides a text-based user interface.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the code using a C compiler of your choice.
3. Run the executable file to start the simulation.

## Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions to control and interact with the cells in the simulation.
